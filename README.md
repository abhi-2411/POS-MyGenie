# POS-MyGenie
Flutter-based POS system prototype where I converted Adobe XD designs into functional screens using VS Code. Focused on UI development and bringing the designs into application-ready layouts.

# Flutter POS System (UI Implementation)

This project is a **Point of Sale (POS) system** built using **Flutter**, where I worked on converting **Adobe XD design files** into fully functional screens inside the application.  

The goal of this project is to create a smooth and user-friendly POS interface that can be extended for real-world use cases like retail, restaurants, or service-based businesses.
